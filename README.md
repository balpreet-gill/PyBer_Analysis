# PyBer_Analysis
### Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to provide PyBer decision makers with the summary of how the ride sharing differs by city type and how these differences can be used to make the company make more successful in business and continue providing ride shares for every type of city. 

### Results
The result of the analysis are as following: 

- This shows the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver and total fare by city type. 
- According to the report, it is clear that rural cities have more average fare per ride and per driver. 
- This might be due to the conditions of the roads and the distance covered in miles. On contrast, rural cities have the least amount of rides shared. This can be interpreted as less people willing to share PyBer rides due to cost factor. 
- And lastly urban cities turned out to be most affordable with largest total rides and drivers for ride shares, which may be due to more readily accessible ride share options and less distance. 

### Summary

## My top three recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types are:
- It will be helpful to advertise about PyBer mainly in rural and suburban areas where people can learn about being a driver for PyBer. 
- The number of drivers are directly correlated with the amount of rides in any city type. By having more drivers, we can increase the total amount of rides in the rural cities. 
- Company can also start some sign on bonus incentives especially during COVID for rural and suburban city drivers, also reducing the average fare per ride on certain days or near holidays will help add benefit to the company in long run.
